Project 2 on Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree

This is my submission for Project 2 ('Investigate a Dataset') on Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.
The project brief asked the student to analyse data from a subset of passengers from the Titanic and identify which factors made people more likely to survive. A description of the dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

The intended project outcomes were to demonstrate the student's ability to form questions based on data; wrangle, clean and analyse data using NumPy and/or Pandas; visualise data using Matplotlib; and practice communicating the results of analysis.
